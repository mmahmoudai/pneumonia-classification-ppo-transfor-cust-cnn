  "title": "Clinically Constrained Reinforcement Learning for Optimized Adaptive Data Augmentation in Chest X-Ray Pneumonia Classification",
  "description": "This project implements a clinically constrained reinforcement learning framework for adaptive data augmentation in chest X-ray pneumonia classification. The framework combines CNN-Transformer hybrid architecture for robust feature extraction, PPO-based RL agent for adaptive augmentation policy learning, clinically constrained action space preserving anatomical plausibility, curriculum learning with safety rollback mechanisms, and multi-objective reward function balancing accuracy, diversity, calibration, and clinical validity. The model achieves 97.23% accuracy on internal test set with excellent calibration (ECE = 0.016) and robust generalization across external cohorts (AUC = 0.950 average).",
